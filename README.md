# basementCloud
Standalone private cloud for my personal development projects.
Built to be deployed on a beefy single 2U supermicro server.

# Requirements
* Ubuntu 16.4
* Lots of RAM. Maybe 16gb min, never tested with less than 32
* At least one big storage disk. More are better
* Actually having reason to own a private cloud.
